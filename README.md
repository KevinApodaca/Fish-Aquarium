## Info
An extra credit assignment for my Advanced Object Oriented Programming class. This program implements 2D graphics to create a Fish Aquarium where a fish will be swimming around, when the fish collides with the borders it will swim around in the opposite direction. 

### Compiling and Running

To run the file first we need to compile the files, so go to the *src* folder and then run:

`$ javac *.java`

This will compile all the java files and produce *.class* files.

Now all we need to do is run:

`$ java Main`

And that's it.
